        Answer basic epidemiological questions using pathogen genomic data,
        without having to become an expert in phylogenetics.

        Developed by genomic epidemiologists, Galago helps public health
        officials interpret phylogenetic trees to make pathogen genomic data
        relevant and actionable during outbreak investigations.
