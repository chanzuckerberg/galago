## What assumptions influence this report?

Most of the data and insights described in this report are strictly observational (meaning they don't depend on heuristics or "judgement calls"). However, there are a few exceptions:

<ul>
  <li>
    We assume that the number of mutations that occurs with each transmission
    ranges between {props.data.muts_bn_selected_minmax[0]} -
    {props.data.muts_bn_selected_minmax[1]}. This determines which samples are
    mostly likely from tertiary cases (onward transmission).
  </li>
  <li>
    When looking for "cousins" (samples that are outside your clade of interest
    but closely related), we look at all the samples that descend from a parent
    (or grandparent, etc) of the primary case of your clade. To select which
    grand/parent to look at (i.e., how narrowly or broadly we search for
    "cousins"), we choose the most recent parent that is separated from your
    clade's primary case by at least {props.data.min_muts_to_parent}{" "}
    mutation(s).
  </li>
</ul>
