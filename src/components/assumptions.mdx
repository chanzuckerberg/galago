## What assumptions influence this report?

_Most of the data and insights described in this report are strictly observational (meaning they don't depend on heuristics or "judgement calls"). However, there are a few exceptions:_

<div className="results">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <Sidenote
        num="8"
        text={`This determines which samples are mostly likely from tertiary cases
      (onward transmission).`}
      />
      We assume that the number of mutations that occurs with each transmission ranges
      between <span className="dataPoint">
        {props.data.muts_per_trans_minmax[0]} -{" "}
        {props.data.muts_per_trans_minmax[1]}
      </span>.<sup fontSize="10">8</sup>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <Sidenote
        num="9"
        text={`
Higher values mean that we search more broadly for "cousins".`}
      />
      When looking for samples that are outside your clade by closely related ("cousins"),
      we trace back to the most recent grand/parent that is separated from the primary
      case by at least <span className="dataPoint">
        {props.data.min_muts_to_parent}
      </span> mutation(s).<sup fontSize="10">9</sup>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
