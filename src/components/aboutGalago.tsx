        Developed by genomic epidemiologists, Galago helps public health
        officials interpret phylogenetic trees to make pathogen genomic data
        more interpretable and actionable during outbreak investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given a tree and a list of samples that you suspect might be part of an
        outbreak, Galago makes observations about your data and automatically
        generates a report which answers basic epidemiological questions.
